# Vue

Website: [https://vuejs.org/](https://vuejs.org/)

We use vue as JavaScript framework for building user interfaces, and there are several reasons we choose Vue:

- **Clear Documentation:** Vue has well-written and comprehensive documentation, which is a significant advantage for new developers or those transitioning from other frameworks.
- **Progressive Framework:** Vue is "progressive," meaning you can use as little or as much of it as needed. You can enhance an existing application with Vue (like adding interactivity to a part of a page) or build a fully-fledged Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Reactive Data Binding:** Vue's reactivity system is one of its standout features. It allows for automatic synchronization between the model and the view. When the data changes, the view updates automatically, making it easier to manage UI states and DOM interactions.
- **Declarative Rendering:** The use of templates in Vue allows developers to describe the desired UI structure declaratively, and Vue takes care of updating the DOM when the data changes.
