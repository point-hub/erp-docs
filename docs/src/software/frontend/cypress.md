We use Cypress as testing framework for front-end development that offers several key advantages, especially when it comes to end-to-end (E2E) testing. Here are some of the main reasons why we choose Cypress for testing:

- **Real-time Browser Interaction:** Cypress runs directly in the browser, so you can see your tests executing in real-time. This gives you an immediate feedback loop, making it easier to debug and understand what's going on.
- **Interactive Test Runner:** Cypress includes an interactive test runner where you can see your tests run and interact with them in real-time. This is especially helpful for debugging and understanding the flow of your tests.
- **Console Logs:** Cypress logs every action in the browserâ€™s console, making it easy to trace and debug failed tests.
- **Time Travel:** Cypress allows you to "time travel" during a test execution, meaning you can hover over each command in the test runner to see the state of your app at that moment. This is extremely useful for troubleshooting.
