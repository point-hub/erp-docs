Pinia is a modern state management library for Vue.js that is quickly gaining popularity as a replacement for Vuex. It was created to offer a more straightforward and flexible solution for managing application state in Vue 3. Here’s why we choose Pinia over other state management solutions:

- **Official Vue 3 State Management Solution:** Pinia is the official state management library for Vue 3. It’s developed and maintained by the Vue.js team, meaning it's built specifically to work well with Vue 3’s Composition API and reactive system.
- **TypeScript Support**: Pinia is fully written in TypeScript and offers excellent TypeScript support out of the box. State types, getters, actions, and mutations are all strongly typed, making development smoother and reducing errors.
- **Less Boilerplate**: Compared to Vuex, Pinia requires less boilerplate. It uses a simpler API and removes the need for mutations. Actions and state can be directly updated within stores, making code easier to write and maintain.
- **Stores are modular**: Pinia encourages a modular approach to state management by allowing you to define multiple stores in a project. You can have stores specific to features or modules, making the app more maintainable and organized.
