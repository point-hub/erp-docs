# Express.js Framework

Website: [https://expressjs.com/](https://expressjs.com/)

We use Express.js as base framework because it is widely used to build APIs and web applications due to its simplicity, flexibility, and extensive support for middleware. 

Here are several key reasons why we choose to use Express.js:

- **Lightweight:** Express is a minimalistic framework that does not enforce too many rules or abstractions, which makes it flexible and easy to get started with. You have full control over how you structure your application.
- **Unopinionated:** It gives developers the freedom to choose how to organize their application and which libraries to integrate. Unlike more opinionated frameworks (like Ruby on Rails), Express doesn't enforce a specific way to structure the app, making it highly customizable.
- **Middleware:** is one of Express's core features, allowing you to add various functionalities to the request-response cycle. Middleware functions can handle things like authentication, logging, error handling, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), input validation, and more.
- **Routing Capabilities:** Express provides powerful and flexible routing. With minimal configuration, you can define routes for HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and organize them in a clean way.
